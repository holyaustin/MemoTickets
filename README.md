# TickVast NFT Marketplace 

### The ticketing system lacks memories that they reflect on remembering special moments from past events. NFTs have come into the picture to make tickets more functional and memorable..

### What are the problems with the traditional ticketing system?

### Fraud marketing of tickets
#### Frauds have plagued the ticketing industry, forcing real fans to pay additional prices while presenting security threats for event organizers.
Misusing the technological advances, ticketing bots cause chaos, enabling online touts to purchase tickets in bulk and sell them on secondary markets at high prices.

### Lack of exchange protocol
#### It is impossible to track customers or exchange data beyond the boundaries of a provided supplier. The lack of exchange protocol enables fraud on the secondary market. When a ticket is sold again on the secondary market, it no longer belongs to the actual buyer whose details the event organizer has.
Therefore, event organizers do not have an idea who is at their event. Because tickets are issued in a way that cannot be used for exchanges on the secondary market, you can neither change the name of the ticket holder nor control how many times the ticket will change hands

### Customer Trust
#### One of the major concerns for guests is whether they have paid for a real ticket or a fake one. Sometimes, customers buy fake tickets on websites posing as legitimate authorized ticketing agents. It leads to loss of money and massive disappointment.

### How does NFT work for Ticketing?

#### NFTs are unique digital tokens stored on the blockchain. Once they are created on the blockchain, they can be sold to customers digitally. Customers then store NFTs in a secure wallet that can be accessed on any device.

In the ticketing system, event organizers can mint the required number of NFT tickets on their choice of a blockchain platform. They can code the NFTs to set a sale price or run the sale as an auction where people can start a bid for tickets.

### A buyer books the NFT-based ticket and pays the ticketing amount to the ticketing company. On receiving the payment, the smart contract triggers and an NFT ticket is sent to the buyer from the ticketing database.

The ticketing company requests to upload the ticket on the IPFS. Hash is calculated by IPFS and tickets get stored on the database. NFT tickets are created and uploaded to the requested NFT marketplace.

Ticket owners can also resell NFT tickets on the NFT marketplace. The ticket is stored in a smart contract. Once a buyer buys the ticket, the smart contract triggers and the payment is sent to the seller automatically.
