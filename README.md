# MemoTickets

This project uses the ERC 721 Smart contract from Open zeppelin. Event owners can create tickets for their event. The tickets are immediately stored to IPFS and are ready on the ticket marketplace for users to purchase either by using their wallet or by using circle's credit card payment processor. After an event, the event organizers create a memorable video of that event as NFT, and users can come back to the site and claim their MemoTicket. This is sent to their wallet address and it is immutable.  after several years to come, they can go back to the wallets and view those memories.
